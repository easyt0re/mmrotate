## Introduction
The original project is mmrotate. I forked a copy for my personal study. Let's hope I did it the correct way. 

I might need to put this to private but I don't know how for the moment. 

- The 1st step, or maybe the 0th step, is to use the "vanilla" version properly, get with the program. 
- [x] through this process, I might want to keep track of commands I use to "set up shops" and automate.
  - seems a bit hard to do. bad docs. search error msg can solve most things.
- The current step is to study a mod version of the project, supposedly. 
- [x] to understand the changes, I might want to update folder by folder. This could also be a backup when I cannot fully understand or capture all the changes.
  - didn't do this part. I probably don't need to. 

daily todo here
- [x] anaylyze tensorboard from yesterday
- [x] o-rep on 2 dataset train more + 200
- [x] r-frcnn implementation


start a todo list here
- [ ] get the result on speed
- [ ] think and search about overfitting
  - [ ] L1 or combination of L1/L2
  - [ ] dropout `true`
  - [ ] increase `iou_thres` in `batch_non_max_suppression`
  - [ ] adam
  - [ ] apparently, lr policy also helps
- [x] change class weights to "balance" weak/strong classes
  - by assign class gain in config file, roi_head, bbox_head, loss
  - [ ] do quick test to confirm we actually have the "correct" understanding of class weight
- [x] reset lr policy to be constant/fixed (by default, it's step)
- [ ] step: change when overfitting (val loss up instead of down)
  - read a bit more, step is not for solving overfitting it seems
  - warm up: "ResNet models, which use a low learning rate that increases linearly to the base learning rate in the first five epochs, and then decreases by a factor of 10 every 30 epochs.". our back bone is resnet. 
  - current steping is not working properly, maybe need to give up
  - already applied to some of the model/set
  - can also use step outside of max epoch to "disable" step
- [x] mentioned [focal loss](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/mmrotate/models/losses/smooth_focal_loss.html), alpha, beta
  - model 2 and 4 use this, tuned alpha and gamma
- [ ] even balance tasks: class/regress
- [x] try [confusion matrix](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/useful_tools.html#confusion-matrix) for visualization
  - worote a .sh to automate gen this for all 8 cases
- [x] run train back to back with sript
- [x] fix cannot resume or load
  - [x] found [this issue](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/issues/10438#issuecomment-1633894504) and try it out
  - probably not the version in use, not really useful
  - [x] confirm hard to get resume working. load works. 
- seems that we have everything from the guy, redo that?
  - [x] PRIORITY: get the code working with our structure of files

start a held list here
- [ ] fine tune idea: looks like by default, stage 1 is frozen at all times. maybe cannot unfreeze. might run into CUDA mem error.
- [x] balanced set: the built-in one seems unsupported with numpy. maybe write my own as custom. 
  - current env: 

| Package Name            | Version  |
|-------------------------|----------|
| mmcv-full               | 1.7.1    |
| mmdet                   | 2.28.2   |
| mmengine                | 0.8.4    |
| mmrotate                | 0.3.4    |
| numpy                   | 1.24.3   |

  - somehow, balanced set is using `numpy.int`, which is removed in 1.20.0
  - if we go `numpy'<1.20.0'`, we will have 1.19.5, which doesn't support `matplotlib`
  - to get around it and mod the file locally, we narrow down to write our own custom dataset and wrapper
  - it's confirmed that we don't have that error anymore but whether it helps with an unbalanced set still needs to be tested
  - these mods should not affect other part of the code
- [x] finally stumbled upon this: [PolyRandomRotate](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#mmrotate.datasets.pipelines.PolyRandomRotate). seems like it only rotate certain classes, might help with unbalanced. however, I still feel like we should sample this class more, or have more in this class, rather than rotate
  - applied this to SOME current "test" versions of config, maybe helped with overfitting
  - [ ] maybe do this to all cases
  - [ ] explore `rect_class`, currently use `None`

tensorboard reading notes here:
- SRS o_rcnn
  - "best"
    - has a "nice" gain we like to follow
    - suspect things happened in the beginning and later of the train -> step policy
  - constant lr "sweep"
    - 5e-2, too big?
    - 5e-3, what we used, OK, something happened before 1/4 or 1/5
    - 5e-4, maybe small, maybe need longer, something happened around 1/4
- CAS o_rcnn
  - max_epoch = 60, something happened right in the middle
  - 150 new best
    - consider step before 1/4, best at 11k/43k, 0.777
  - 50CA1e2
    - also something happened around 12k, coincidence? 0.75. 1e-2 might to large
- o_rep
  - ~max_epoch = 80, hasn't reach overfitting yet -> run longer, load from~
  - CA, could train longer, almost stable, maybe small lr, something good at 5k/22k
    - to 150, increased a little, consider step
  - SR, definitely train longer, 80 at 0.4, meaning 160 to see if 0.6, start with larger lr?
    - increased indeed, consider maybe even longer, 200. 150 is now 
- rfrcnn
  - SR, 100, best at 60, seems flat, consider step

note for given
- seems range(0,1) is the same as 0 (1 gpu train)
- all have specified work_dir, good, run for SR
- need to change data_root or move data
- need to change sample_per_gpu and worker_per_gpu
  - see [this page](https://github.com/Adamdad/ConsistentTeacher/issues/19) here, we will need to try
  - CA reached 8, 8. (rfrcnn) but may not help
- use --auto-resume flag in cmd to get true and seems to be working
  - resume not working but auto fine...

MMRotate is an open-source toolbox for rotated object detection based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab project](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10410257/154433305-416d129b-60c8-44c7-9ebb-5ba106d3e9d5.MP4

<details open>
<summary><b>Major Features</b></summary>

- **Support multiple angle representations**

  MMRotate provides three mainstream angle representations to meet different paper settings.

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the rotated object detection framework into different components,
  which makes it much easy and flexible to build a new model by combining different modules.

- **Strong baseline and State of the art**

  The toolbox provides strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods in rotated object detection.

</details>

## What's New

### Highlight

We are excited to announce our latest work on real-time object recognition tasks, **RTMDet**, a family of fully convolutional single-stage detectors. RTMDet not only achieves the best parameter-accuracy trade-off on object detection from tiny to extra-large model sizes but also obtains new state-of-the-art performance on instance segmentation and rotated object detection tasks. Details can be found in the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07784). Pre-trained models are [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate/tree/1.x/configs/rotated_rtmdet).

**0.3.4** was released in 01/02/2023:

- Fix compatibility with numpy, scikit-learn, and e2cnn.
- Support empty patch in Rotate Transform
- use iof for RRandomCrop validation

Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/en/changelog.md) for details and release history.

## Installation

MMRotate depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
Below are quick steps for installation.
Please refer to [Install Guide](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more detailed instruction.

dd: this seems to be outdated. the installation steps in the [Install Guide](https://mmrotate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) have a more updated version. 

dd: although the one in the docs also has some problem. once reached verify, step 1 will already give you some error. the inference demo is even worse. 

dd: lesson of the day 20230923: why did I try to do this on windows? at least start from WSL

dd: change to WSL still has trouble downloading o_rcnn.py. but there is already a version of it in configs folder, using that one for the moment. somehow dd managed to run the download line. do comparison later. 

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 pytorch==1.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 torchvision -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip install openmim
mim install mmcv-full
mim install mmdet
# dd: will stuck here with "OSError: CUDA_HOME environment variable is not set. 
#     Please set it to your CUDA install root."
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate.git
cd mmrotate
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -v -e .
```
